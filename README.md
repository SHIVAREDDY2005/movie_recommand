ðŸ“– Project Description
The Movie Recommendation System is a content-based movie recommender that suggests similar movies based on metadata and credits. It uses information such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords to calculate similarity between movies.
The system is built with Python and an interactive Streamlit app, allowing users to simply enter the name of a movie and get a list of recommended movies in return.
This project demonstrates how data preprocessing, feature engineering, and similarity algorithms can be applied to solve real-world problems like personalized movie recommendations. It is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and easily extendable to hybrid or collaborative approaches in the future.
